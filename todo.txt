zedsystem todo

tp to bifindsafepos player - but within location bounds --- not to location cause it will make them continually TP until near the player - not efficient
increase radius values for some locations - too small - done
increase max zeds generally for some locations such as airports - kind of done
	
much much testing to see how current system is functioning

optimize:
-use global variable defined as _city so we can set the variable on it without doing a find in for that part in the TP script
-bis_fnc_findASafePos - is this fast enough to use, is there something else we can do
-tp zeds only to a position close to place, never to somewhere far - so they only get tp'd once, instead of repeating the process till close
-drop maxsleeping zeds to 150 or less -- we shouldn't need to cache many more than that --- done set to 100
-setpos is actually sync'd across the network, so I don't know how great this is gonna be, but it should be better
-moveto overwrite current position to move to --- done with vector math

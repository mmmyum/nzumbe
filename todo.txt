zedsystem todo

tp to bifindsafepos player - but within location bounds --- not to location cause it will make them continually TP until near the player - not efficient
increase radius values for some locations - too small
increase max zeds generally for some locations such as airports - 
domove vs moveto vs commandmove vs move vs waypoints -- one of these we can use, somehow
	to get the zeds to goddamn overwrite their last moveto command. 

much much testing to see how current system is functioning
